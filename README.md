# Stake Front-End Task

## Description

A lightweight stock tracking and investment app built with `Angular` and `Ionic`, enabling users to monitor their holdings, purchase stocks and calculate investment values.

## Features

- `Investment` tab
- Display list of market stocks with calculated changes
- Add stocks to user holdings (without calculated amount and shares)
- Purchase selected stock modal
- Show success notification
- Animated flow

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
2. Start development server `ionic serve`

## Approaches

- Adopt `Presentational and Container Components` architecture
- Break the app into small, reusable UI components
- Implement performance optimizations, such as efficient change detection and `trackBy` for lists
- Use `Reactive Forms` and `Observables` to manage state reactively
- Apply `lazy loading` and modular architecture to reduce initial load time
- Utilize `Ionic gestures` and `animations` for smooth user interactions
- Apply clean coding practices, consistent naming, and clear folder structure for scalability
